# Applying Visual Design Principles to YouTube

We devoted a significant portion of today's lecture to the key elements of visual design, with a particular focus on layout. As someone who tends to think more logically, I find layout to be the most important, as it involves organizing information in a way that is both visually convenient and appealing to the user. So, let's analyze the layout of everyone's favorite video-streaming platform: **YouTube**!

Much can be said about the entirety of YouTube's design, but we will focus on the video section of the homepage. Let's take a look at YouTube's current homepage design:

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;">
  <img src="/../assets/images/current_homepage.webp" alt="current_homepage">
</div>

We are met with a nice grid system that uses a healthy amount of whitespace, which is useful in a platform that lays out a considerable amount of visual information. The user might, otherwise, get overwhelmed. All of the regular video previews have identical thumbnail, profile picture, title, and channel name structure. This is useful in telling the user the main 4-5 components to look for when deciding to click on a video or not. The relative sizes of these components matter as well since the main eye-catcher of a video preview is the thumbnail, the biggest component. If the user is intrigued, there is more detail below the thumbnail, the title and channel profile picture being the focus.

We also notice that each video preview is the same size. I contrast this with the Washington Post example from lecture, in which the articles were of various different sizes based on relevance or importance. Compared to this, I really like YouTube's approach because the design is not telling me which video is more important, but leaves that task to me. The hierarchy of importance is rather conveyed in which videos are more towards the bottom vs the top when scrolling up and down. There is also a clear distinction between the video previews. There are no gridlines but the whitespace between videos that are horizontally next to each other definitely helps the user distinguish. The previews are also fairly small in size on a desktop, which is good according to the Gestalt principle that users prefer smaller objects.

Let's now talk about user navigation. The YouTube mobile app is similar to typical social media layouts where users simply scroll top to bottom and the video preview takes up the width of the screen:

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;">
  <img src="/../assets/images/mobile_scrolling.jpg" alt="mobile_scrolling" width="300">
</div>

As for the desktop layout in a standard 100% zoom, each row of the videos section spans 4 videos, and the previews shift to the next row. I think this makes it simple for the user to more or less view every video in a row and move on to the next row as they scroll top to bottom. Having a simple top-to-bottom video navigation layout is great! Compare this to Netflix's navigation:

<div align="center" style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;">
  <img src="/../assets/images/netflix_navigation.jpg" alt="netflix_navigation">
</div>

This layout has top-to-bottom navigation for the rows, but left-to-right navigation within each row. This has the benefit of grouping video categories into rows, but it adds that extra degree of navigation complexity. It is a trade off, but I believe the simple top-to-bottom navigation is better suited for YouTube given that users can make custom playlists and search up videos of a certain category already.

Overall, YouTube is great!
