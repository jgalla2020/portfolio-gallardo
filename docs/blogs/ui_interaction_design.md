# Blog 1: Applying Usability Criteria to ChatGPT

In November 2022, OpenAI launched this revolutionary LLM. I would argue that I use this app the most during a regular semester, and I find it quite appealing. So, in this blog, I will explore the user interaction design of ChatGPT.

<h2 align='center'>Usability Criteria</h2>

### Ease of Use:

- <b>Discoverable</b>: The simple prompt-response model of GPT makes it easy to use for the first time. A user can type a simple question, hit the send button, and receive a response when testing out its generative capabilities. In fact, recent versions of GPT suggest to the user what they can ask to get the gears rolling.

- <b>Efficient</b>: The time it takes to receive a response depends on the size and detail of the prompt, but responses generally take a couple of seconds.
- <b>Error-Tolerant</b>: I like how GPT is robust to prompt typos in that it can still understand what the user meant to type. Likewise, if the user makes an error to the point that the response is not useful, they can hit the stop button and fix their prompt. Even if the response completes, the user may still edit their prompt to get a new response.

### Pleasantness:

The GPT layout is pretty compact. The user creates a thread simply by initiating a conversation that they're able to revisit by scrolling up or down like in a text message history. The user can also quickly switch between threads by just clicking on a thread in the sidebar. This intuitive use of GPT is quite pleasant! It is similar to having a natural one-on-one conversation.

### Safety:

I can talk about this criteria from a psychological and guideline compliance standpoint. From what I understand, GPT models are designed to encourage constructive conversation and avoid discussions that could promote unethical activities. I've personally experienced this. I can recall times when I would ask GPT questions on an assignment and part of the response would be, "It is important to conduct your own research using relevant resources...". I have yet to see GPT criticize or be rude to me! Likewise, if the user asks an inappropriate question (i.e., asking GPT to render the face of a famous actor), GPT will give a message stating why it is unable to fulfill the user's request without going into the specifics of the guidelines that it must follow.

### Security:

In GPT, personal data is not used to identify users. GPT also cannot access external databases or real-time information. However, plenty of these features are confidential and difficult to validate from a typical user's perspective.

### Accessibility:

I currently find no built-in accessibility features that GPT offers. It is mainly third-party tools like screen readers and browser extensions that currently meet this need (i.e., Google Assistant or Siri). In this sense, the user interface is not all-encompassing even though it excels in text-based conversational AI.
