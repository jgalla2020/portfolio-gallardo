# Assignment 2

<h2 align="center"> 
    Broad Application Goals
</h2>

**Name**: Seek-N-Find

**Intended Audience Description**: This app is for people seeking virtual one-on-one life and spiritual mentorship.

**Added User Value Beyond Existing Apps**: Most social media apps entice users to make connections without effectively motivating them to cultivate fruitful relationships. To solve this, my app combines the matchmaking capabilities of dating apps, the organization and reminders offered by calendar apps, and the real-time collaboration of Google Docs to foster genuine, long-lasting human connections in a concise, streamlined manner.

### Google Docs Share

<div align="center">
  <img src="/../assets/images/google_doc_clip.png" alt="google_doc_clip" width="500">
</div>

This is the Google Docs share functionality where the user can add recipient's emails, write a message, and set different permission roles. This could be used to share personal notes or other deliverables to mentors or mentees.

### Google Docs Google Meet

<div align="center">
  <img src="/../assets/images/google_meet_clip.png" alt="google_meet_clip" width="300">
</div>

This is the side bar that pops up when starting a Google Meets call from Google Docs. The user can add callers. This can be used to hop on a call in Seek-N-Find with a mentor or mentee to review documents that can be screen shared.

### When2Meet Group Availability

<div align="center">
  <img src="/../assets/images/when2meet_availability.png" alt="when2meet_availability" width="300">
</div>

This is the when2meet grid where people can fill in times at which they're available. This can be used to show availability times to other people that users interact with in Seek-N-Find.

### Preply Promotional Video

<div align="center">
  <img src="/../assets/images/preply_promo.png" alt="preply_promo" width="500">
</div>

Preply is an online platform where people can meet language teachers. This is a picture of the search results. You hover over the thumbnail and play the video on the side. This can easily be incorporated into Seek-N-Find's mentorship profiles to give users an idea of who the mentor is.

### Audible Genre Selection

<div align="center">
  <img src="/../assets/images/audible_genre.png" alt="audible_genre" width="500">
</div>

This is in Audible's homepage. Customers can select a genre and then select subgenres in the following page. This can help Seek-N-Find's users an idea of the available mentorship options.

### Duolingo Gamified Learning

<div align="center">
  <img src="/../assets/images/duolingo_game.png" alt="duolingo_game" width="500">
</div>

This shows Duolingo's language exercises presented as levels to be beaten. As the user progresses, new levels are unlocked, the user gains points and unlocks rewards. Perhaps this gamification concept can be applied to Seek-N-Find to entice users to meet certain requirements to be mentored by others in the platform.

### Google Fitbit Progress and Goal Setting

<div align="center">
  <img src="/../assets/images/fitbit_goal.png" alt="fitbit_goal" width="500">
</div>

This is the Fitbit website. The phone screen on the right shows the user's exercise progress for the day, and how many steps remaining to complete the daily goal. I would like to use this in Seek-N-Find for the mentor and mentee to explicitly establish mentorship goals that they can both view for accountability.

### Calendly Appointment Scheduling

<div align="center">
  <img src="/../assets/images/calendly_scheduling.png" alt="calendly_scheduling" width="500">
</div>

This is the user selecting from different dates that a person is available at. In the following page the user can select from different times. Seek-N-Find can have a similar feature for mentees to seamlessly schedule an appointment with their mentor, or vice versa.

### Slack Starring

<div align="center">
  <img src="/../assets/images/slack_starring.gif" alt="slack_starring" width="500">
</div>

This is a GIF showcasing a useful feature in Slack, a workplace messaging application, that is used to label important channels or conversations to review in the future and to be included in a recap provided to the user.

### LinkedIn Follow-Up Feature

<div align="center">
  <img src="/../assets/images/linkedin_follow.png" alt="linkedin_follow" width="500">
</div>

This is a small feature within LinkedIn's My Network tab where users can follow up with people within their network. This could be extended and improved to provide more engaging ways for Seek-N-Find's users to continue engaging with their connections.

### Google Keep

<div align="center">
  <img src="/../assets/images/google_keep_org.png" alt="google_keep_org" width="500">
</div>

This is Google Keep's note-making feature. These notes can be labeled and pinned for priority. I think for an app where users might be meeting with multiple mentors and writing down notes from one-on-ones, it'd be useful to provide a way to organize that within the app.

    Brainstorming Feature Ideas
</h2>

<!-- For each feature provide a succint description in 3-4 sentences. -->

### Availability Grid

This is a grid where users can specify their availability to be viewed on their profile, similar to how it is done in when2meet. Users can denote daily, weekly, monthly, or even yearly availability. Users will be able to create sections of time and assign a score from a numerical range specifying their level of freedom, if they desire to do so.

### Mentor-and-Mentee Connection Criteria

This is an updatable connection settings subpage where mentors and mentees can impose profile requirements on the other party that would like to make a connection request. The mentor/mentee can decide to denote these as preferences or strict requirements so that they're only reached by solicitors that they might be interested in.

### Mentorship Type Selection

Based on Audible's genre and subgenre selection feature, Seek-N-Find would both give users the ability to filter for desired mentors. This can also be laid out in the selection of general categories to help users narrow down their desired scope, and then introduce them more specific configurations.

### Matchmaking Contract

Similar to dating apps that form a match when both parties agree to connect, Seek-N-Find will have a feature where users will make a mentor-mentee commitment. Instead of simply forming a mutual connection, there will be a procedure where users sign some form of a contract making a commitment. Often times in dating apps there is no follow through with the connection, but this feature would convey the seriousness with which to approach a match.

### Questionnaire

After making a match, the app allows mentors and mentees the option of submitting an introductory questionnaire to each other. The mentor can send a questionnaire for the mentee to fill out, and vice versa. This questionnaire can also be customized with specific questions, or standard questions in pre-made templates. This option can also be a reflection exercise to be done in a recurring basis.

### Mentorship Goal Setting

This feature allows the mentor give assignments and due dates for the mentee. This feature will also have a component where the mentee approves these assignments and thus committing themselves to completing them.

### Mentee Goal Tracker

Based on Fitbit's goal setting functionality, after making a mentor-mentee match and receiving assignments, the mentee can take a look at a progress bar that tracks their goal completion. They would also receive reminders on a recurring basis depending on the due date.

### Connection Priority Ranking

Not all relationships are treated the same or have the same priority level, so this priority ranking feature would allow the user to assign a priority level to different connections. Based on priority level, the user will receive encouragements to follow up with connections.

### Video Call

In the spirit of fostering human connection, there can be a button to start a call to which the mentor or mentee can invite the other party, or multiple parties. Similar to Zoom, there would be the ability to share files via a chat and share user screens.

### Add to Calendar

This is a standard feature where the user exports their appointments to their personal calendar. Given the possibility of scheduling mentorship meetings it'd be useful for the user to keep this in their personal records.

### Profile Status Toggle

In the case that connections have already been made and the mentor or mentee are no longer in need of a mentor for the time being, the user can turn off the ability for them to be reached by other parties who may be eligible given the user's preferences.

### Share Items

Similar to Google Docs, there would be a feature where users can share files or documents on which both the mentor and the mentee can collaborate and edit in real time.

### Eligibility Point System

In response to the conection criteria feature, this point system feature allows the user who may want to connect with a certain mentor or mentee to see the eligibility requirements and a game plan for how to meet them given their current status.

### Promotional Video

Based on Preply's introductory video feature, this is a feature where the mentee can view a 30-45 second promo video showcasing the mentor's background and mentorship style.

### Connections Grouping and Tagging

This allows the user to group their connections into different categories since someone might have different types of mentors. They could also add descriptions or further details.

    VSD Analysis
</h2>

<!-- For each domain, record an observation and design response -->

1. **Non-Targeted Use**: People may pose as mentors and give assignments requiring personal information from minors using the app. I can add an adult supervision feature where the child's guardian must approve certain interactions in the app between the child and the mentor, such as sharing deliverables that may contain personal information. I can also restrict the task assignment feature to only require appropriate information.
2. **Appropriation by Cultural Groups**: I can see Seek-N-Find being used by the Christian community (i.e., pastors or church teachers) to disciple teenagers or young adults, which is normally done in-person and tends to be loosely organized. This might require giving the option for the mentor-mentee pair to turn off goal setting and the like to make it more accessible for younger audience that would like a more informal relationship.
3. **Widespread Use**: If the app is used by millions of users, interactions might very well become less personal due to potential oversaturation of mentees without enough mentors that want to offer free mentorship. Perhaps it would help to add a lateral interaction feature where users can receive peer mentorship, with less stringent contractual requirements.
4. **Value Tensions**: There is definitely a tension between accessibility and eligibility in this app. The eligibility point system could incentivize users to be more well-prepared going into their mentorships, but it might discourage some users from seek out mentorship if the requirements are too high. Adding an option for a user to solicit a connection with a written reason for being qualified might help this.
5. **Variation in Human Ability**: Some users may be highly inexperienced with the organizational techy tools that Seek-N-Find may offer, and may be overwhelmed by features such as the point system, priority ranking, and goal setting. I think that creating a tutorial mode that users can enable so that if they hover over an app component, it explains to them the basic functoinality or redirects them to a video tutorial.
