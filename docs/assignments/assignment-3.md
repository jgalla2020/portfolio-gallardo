    Product Pitch
</h2>

Seek-N-Find is a mentorship-driven social media app meant for goal-oriented individuals seeking one-on-one mentor-mentee connections for life and spiritual matters. Many social media platforms entice users to make connections without effectively motivating them to cultivate fruitful relationships. To solve this, Seek-N-Find combines matchmaking capabilities, the organization and reminders offered by calendar tools, and real-time collaboration features to foster genuine, long-lasting human connections in a concise, streamlined manner.

This app allows users, both mentors and mentees, to specify their general availability, mentorship goals, and connection preferences and eligibility requirements in a standardized format within their profile. Users can search for mentors and mentees by browsing through categories and sub-categories provided in the app or by conducting filtered searches. They can view others' profile information and express interest in a mentor or mentee by sending a connection request. Upon expressing mutual interest, two users can form a mentor-mentee match. They can then begin to schedule introductory calls in the app or collaboratively write up agendas and long-term goals using the shared notes feature, among other tools.
