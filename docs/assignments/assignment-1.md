# Assignment 1

## My Interview Hunch

I would like to build a social media app for users who offer services to K-12 and college students, since Facebook and Instagram might be too general. In this particular setting, I want to know how to foster deep human connections through social media.

## Justifications for Interviews

One of my personal deterrents for using mainstream social media is its inherent overemphasis on creating connections, as opposed to building them. That said, by incorporating the right perspectives, I believe that social media can improve in this area so that its tremendous capacity to connect users can still be leveraged.

So, I considered two people who are not frequent users of social media yet understand its utility. These interviewees are:

1. **Thomas Ray Garcia**: an English professor at South Texas College who founded a nonprofit organization that “teaches college access classes and connects near-peer mentors to high school students.”
2. **Steven Xavier Longoria**: a Stanford University alumnus with a degree in Computer Science who is currently a serving at MIT as an Evangelical Christian college pastor.

As an advocate of creating deep, long-lasting social connections, and a novice social media user, I set out to interview these two community-oriented mentorship figures.

From the interviewees, I would like to learn about:

- Their personal relationship to social media.
- Their opinion on the general use of social media by the students they serve.
- How they might use social media apps to reach their client base and foster community building within their respective jobs.
- Any hesitancies that they may have in using social media, and the reason(s) why.

As for diversity of perspectives, Thomas Garcia works in the Rio Grande Valley at a two-year college in South Texas serving a predominantly Hispanic population only a few minutes away from the U.S.-Mexico border, whereas Steven Longoria works for a Christian ministry organization serving undergraduate and graduate students at a demographically diverse institution. I also note that Steven Longoria may use a wider set of social media apps, ranging from Facebook to Instagram for a variety of purposes.

## Background Research

My main inspiration for this endeavor was the 2020 documentary The Social Dilemma, a film that focuses on technological addiction, the psychological toll of social media on regular users, and algorithmically enabled user behavior modification. With these social risks in mind, I begin to explore how to create an app that is redeemed from these qualities.
