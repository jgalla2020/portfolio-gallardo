# Assignment 1

## My Interview Hunch

I would like to build a social media app for users who offer services to K-12 and college students, since Facebook and Instagram might be too general.

## Justifications for Interviews

One of my personal deterrents for using mainstream social media is its inherent overemphasis on creating connections, as opposed to building them. That said, by incorporating the right perspectives, I believe that social media can improve in this area so that its tremendous capacity to connect users can still be leveraged.

So, I considered two people who are not frequent users of social media yet understand its utility. These interviewees are:

1. **Thomas Ray Garcia**: an English professor at South Texas College who founded a nonprofit organization that “teaches college access classes and connects near-peer mentors to high school students.”
2. **Steven Xavier Longoria**: a Stanford University alumnus with a degree in Computer Science who is currently a serving at MIT as an Evangelical Christian college pastor.

As an advocate of creating deep, long-lasting social connections, and a novice social media user, I set out to interview these two community-oriented mentorship figures.

From the interviewees, I would like to learn about:

- Their personal relationship to social media.
- Their opinion on the general use of social media by the students they serve.
- How they might use social media apps to reach their client base and foster community building within their respective jobs.
- Any hesitancies that they may have in using social media, and the reason(s) why.

As for diversity of perspectives, Thomas Garcia works in the Rio Grande Valley at a two-year college in South Texas serving a predominantly Hispanic population only a few minutes away from the U.S.-Mexico border, whereas Steven Longoria works for a Christian ministry organization serving undergraduate and graduate students at a demographically diverse institution. I also note that Steven Longoria may possess more knowledge of social media apps given his computer science background.

## Background Research

My main inspiration for this endeavor was the 2020 documentary The Social Dilemma, a film that focuses on technological addiction, the psychological toll of social media on regular users, and algorithmically enabled user behavior modification. With these social risks in mind, I begin to explore how to create an app that is redeemed from these qualities.

## Sample Interview Questions

_The questions within sub-bullets are follow-ups to the question that they are under._

## Interview Summaries & Takeaways

### Interview 1 - Thomas Ray Garcia

**Summary**: Thomas discussed the educational goals that he is accomplishing through his college-access nonprofit organization and as a college professor in a bicultural region with a 27% poverty rate. He then talked at length about how his low-income background and the lack of near-peer mentorship in high school led him to construct a network of college students and alumni who could mentor current high school students seeking higher education. He mentioned that he announces his academic workshops through Instagram, receiving inquiries from parents, and supporting students connect with a mentor listed on their website outside of the traditional school system. He expressed a desire for social media platforms to make it easier to fill out customized forms so that students can very easily connect.

**Analysis**: An interesting detail is Thomas mentioning that when he was considering applying to out-of-state colleges, "it felt impossible to find alumni from [his] high school that went to out-of-state colleges" that he could reach out to for college application advice. Going to school in a low-income region where most people go to the local college, having a mentor with a non-traditional experience is a precious rarity. I was also particularly surprised by Thomas’ methodology to create mentor-mentee connections. If he saw engagement and willingness from the student to pursue higher levels of mentorship then he would refer them to someone in his network, but the mentor profile wouldn’t be made available on his website. Though his intention was to foster connections, I noticed that he still exercised caution when creating the connections to ensure that the mentor's time would not be wasted. Lastly, Thomas mentioned connecting with parents through his nonprofit organization's Instagram account as the primary means to offer his services to high school students. I hadn't understood the importance of parental involvement when dealing with high school students, especially since school districts can be stricter than higher learning institutions when external organizations reach out to students.

### Interview 2 - Steven Xavier Longoria

**Summary**: After a brief discussion of his typical daily activities, Steven described his love-hate relationship with social media. He enumerated ways that he uses it beneficially such as to raise funds for his ministry and connect with old friends but made it clear that he prefers face-to-face communication to be properly understood. When asked about his view of general social media usage, he criticized the way it enticed users to act compulsively, and he used marketing ads as an example. He gave a personal example of how his father has given in to buying things online without exercising self-control. We then began to discuss relationships within social media, and Steven mentioned that though he appreciates having more accessibility to people, he acknowledges that social media does not compel people to strengthen the depth of their relationships. He showed me two apps that he uses, Brightwheel for his son’s daycare and Meal Train to donate to friends in need.

**Analysis**: I was awed by Steven’s strong claims about how the “[social media] system is built on drawing people’s attention to thing that is trying to sell to them” and also “[capitalizes] on people’s greatest moment of weakness.” I had a conception about social media’s foothold on teenagers’ attention, but hearing Steven substantiate his claim with 30+ year old adult examples was new territory for me. He also brought up a meaningful anecdote of how he used a social media app called Meal Train to send meal donations to a friend’s spouse that was diagnosed with cancer. This expanded my conception of what social media apps can be used for besides posting pictures and videos for people to comment on. This became a talking point that culminated in him saying, “people need to be reeducated on what social media is.” Did I need to be reeducated? What followed were some basic examples of social media apps that Steven highly appreciated because they had a specific purpose: Slack for connecting with co-workers, Brightwheel to connect with other parents at his son’s daycare, and Discord to manage different gameplay communities. I didn’t even consider these apps to be social media, just simple messaging platforms, so there are more functionalities that I haven’t considered yet for what social media apps can do.

## App Design Opportunities

_Some of these design opportunities are aimed at addressing in part any major theme brought up during the interviews, whereas others are focused on secondary aspects of the person's comment that could still be deemed helpful._

1. **Widening the types of groups that people can create on social media**

What if a person or organization on social media wanted to be reached out to by a collective family unit, friend group, couple, etc? Thomas explained to me that he connects with parents on Instagram to ultimately provide services to students. He does this out of respect for parental authority since he works with ages 14-18. This back-and-forth communication can be hard to keep track of in especially important matters such as due diligence that might involve multiple parties, such as a parent granting permission to their child to go to a college-access workshop. Exploring this opportunity might streamline communication for service providers that must deal with multiple parties.

2. **Allowing for highly customizable ways for an account owner to engage with his audience on social media**

Often times social media accounts are simply the gateway to other online content, and account owners must create custom forms to gather customer information when redirecting them. Given this, I'm interested in figuring out a way to give users a way to easily embed their own digital platforms on their accounts or customizing customer engagement systems within the app itself. Thomas described how he adds a Linktree URL to his organization's Instagram bio to house important links (i.e., his organization's website). He expressed concern for students potentially finding this confusing, so this idea could provide a faster alternative.

3. **Providing ways for users to impose requirements on social media connections**

Social media apps like LinkedIn give users the ability to limit who can reach out to them. This is a useful feature, but I'd like to explore how this can be extended to allow User A to require User B to meet some criteria before sending a connection request, such as proven and verified experience in some domain. Both interviewees emphasized the importance of meaningful connections. Thomas described a very stringent mentor-mentee matchmaking process, and Steven highly valued deepening and being intentional with social media connections as opposed to connecting for the sake of connecting. This design opportunity could act as an automatic preliminary screening to aid the users in accepting a connection request and getting off to a good start with the other person.

## Raw User Interview Notes

### Interview 1 Notes - Thomas Ray Garcia

- Thomas Ray Garcia is an English professor at STC. He is the founder of CSLAP. He now serves as the chair of the board. Fundraising and scaling programs.
- He comes from a low-income background. Wants to make the process easier for students like him. He wants to create a program to support local school districts in Hidalgo County.
- He wants to educate students on the importance of language and liberal arts so that they can unlock skills in critical writing and reading for careers that they might want to pursue in the future.
- English can be a struggle to learn and implement. There is a significant English language learner. There is a lack of literacy in the region. There is a 27% poverty rate and growing up in a bicultural region.
- Trying to balance both worlds on your shoulders is difficult. Students can engage in critical ideas of culture and identity. Students can inform analyses on real-world issues.
- Thomas initially felt alienated because of the cultural norms. The institution normalized social networking and learning for the sake of learning. There was a culture shock! There were class differences.
- Princeton  learning from people in diverse backgrounds. And looking at that as a positive identity.
- Recognize the worthiness of each student’s story. You treat them as if they are worthy of a Princeton education. He instills a love of learning and the liberal arts in storytelling.
- Students can enter an abundance mindset.
- Readings that focus on relatable/lived experiences about the border community. The reading list matters in that regard. The assignments that they do together relate to the real world.
- One stigma that students have against higher education is that credits and courses are gateways towards an associate degree, certificate or four-year degree. But, it is important to instill the act of learning!
- He approached teaching his courses in the same vein.

- Typical day --> 8-4pm (STC)

  - Grading
  - Preparing for teaching
  - Doing service at the college

- CSLAP Work
- Publishing Company
- Author
- Long Distance Runner
- If I do these things, then I have lived a fulfilling day!
- Reserving an hour of creative writing time per day.
- Transition activities. Does things that he enjoys doing.

- STC is the most diverse. It is a former community college.
- Beyond Borders Books: wide community of writers. They are very different from STC and CSLAP. The genres of writing.

  - It was initially a book club.
  - It was meant to bring like-minded readers together.
  - There is a need to create an active community of readers and writers  having them become producers as well.

- How do you reach students?

  - The idea is for them to have a greater sense of self.
  - What helps students and parents understand CSLAP is their near-peer mentorship…
  - Giving CSLAP alumni back through the platform! This is meant to fill in the social capital gap.
  - Meeting someone who is in their shoes.

- Thomas served as a near-peer mentor to his friends during high school. He went on to Princeton University. Thomas received messages on the college admissions process from people a year below him. He spent a lot of time one-on-one. He spent time giving unique mentorship that others could not give.
- Thomas did not have to have a college degree immediately.
- Teaching workshops --> Expanding the platform, any recent graduate from any high school in Hidalgo County.

- Connecting with students virtually and providing asynchronous materials. Providing essay revisions, even if there is not there physically.
- He felt like it was nearly impossible to reach out to students who had graduated from PSJA and went on to upstate universities.
- Students simply reach out by seeing a mentor profile on the internet.

- Technologies:

  - Digital: website made from Wix. There are multiple apps on the website that enables them to receive information and store it. Boom Form  Easily fill in information sent to CSLAP. This is how students/parents enroll in summer and after school programs. Listing most cooperative and active mentors. Active students are referred to an active network mentor.
  - Social Media: has allowed CSLAP to reach students and parents where they are. Before, they would be confined to meeting students through school district partnerships. But, students and parents can reach out to CSLAP directly for support of any kind, and participate in the programs offered. Social media often targets parents so that they can enroll their kids in a mentor. - Beyond Borders Books: primarily online (social media) connections. The majority of the referrals to the website come through social media.
  - Wix --> Unique insights into who is visiting the pages. Without the visitor analytics app, there are still great reports. He wishes that was a little more refined. They will get an approximate location, but knowing the side of town.
  - If social media platforms made it easier to fill out forms, it’d be better. Asking students to click on yet another link led to more people dropping off. The fewer clicks the better. LinkTree is a tool that enables people to put multiple links on one page (url). It is useful for Instagram. Students would get overwhelmed.

- He feels that it is much easier to make mistakes with written text.
- Steven will try to have a face-to-face communication.

- The organization has more power over the individual that he is comfortable with.
- Feels that mobile devices have made that a lot worse.
- Multiple ads pop up before he even types in his Google search. The system itself is built on drawing people’s attention to the thing that is trying to sell them.

- He has seen his father have less impulse control, even though he considers him someone who has impulse control.

- How does social media know that I know that person??
- It is so much easier to connect with people and develop relationships.
- Feeling that her wife’s life is not as good as other people. The people online are avatars, not the actual people. People curate their persona, and it is not their real selves. It is unhealthy for people to feel like everyone else is better than them.
- It creates an illusion! It is damaging to people’s psyche.

- He says that he questions the value/depth of the relationships made through social media.

- It is easier to CONNECT to people, but it does not compel you to strengthen the depth of that relationship. It compels you to connect and stay connected.
  - You’ll see someone’s post.
  - You’ll see if they have a birthday, a wedding, etc.
  - But, if he hasn’t talked to them face-to-face on the phone, then he doesn’t know them on a deep level.
  - That is something that he has to do of his own volition.
  - He cannot do that with everybody! He can have a handful of relationships.
- He has more accessibility to people, compared to his parents.
- He has seen Discord to be a helpful form of social media. Staying in touch with people. It is something that he didn’t have before.

- He pulled out an app called brightwheel, for his child’s daycare. Check-in and check out logs for his birthday. He has calendar events. And paperwork and medical information.
- The daycare will send a post each day. There is DMing the supervisors.
- There is a parent directory. He can connect with other parents. It streamlines communication. Instead of having Google docs of email, and him having to store and update the information himself.
- Other daycares use brightwheel.

- He was initially annoyed about installing brightwheel. Another app??
- He does not have a lot of social media apps.
- He thought that it was pretty nice, one of the most positive experiences.
- It is a very niche, and helpful thing, instead of having to sift through emails and stuff like that.
- Steven can check in and check out from the daycare, and take a picture.

- He has done daycare and has gone through the difficulty of less technical methods of managing kids.
- His bias is that social media is Instagram and Facebook, a place where you stay connected mass amounts of people through shallow interactions, like posting a picture.
- He studied CS, so he has high trust of technology, and how it is set up. Someone would have to steal his phone. He feels that it is the same level of security.

- Is it possible to build genuine connections in social media?

  - Discord is not something that he thought of as social media until the beginning of the conversation.
  - Retraining the audience to redefine their understanding of what social media is.
  - People who use social media actively spend so much time on social media. Social media breeds on lack of impulse control.
  - Slack: working virtually has become a lot easier. It improves feeling connected to workers. There has to be some level of connection to the worker.
  - CREATING AS LITTLE SPACE AS POSSIBLE FOR MISCOMMUNICATION.

- There are certain social cues that are lost virtually. There should be a space where there are shared understandings of what the social cues are. Creating a way for social rules to be understood within that virtual space.

- Example of where it is going well:
  - Has a friend in ministry that was diagnosed with cancer.
  - Meal Train, a website where people can give donations and sign up to give donations. You are setting up meals recurringly to support someone who is in need.
  - Cancer --> people are private about it. That is very very helpful. The person can post their updates once per week.
  - He feels like he knows what is going on. The person doesn’t need to update the people themselves.
  - We know what we’re using this space for.
  - There is a personal ownership component. People ought to make that choice.
- People should put in the work to have a deep relationship with other people.
- Right away: he knows the social rule. It is a narrow thing. No one there will say that they’re gonna go have a beer. How? Understanding the community in real life. The subtext was clear to him.

- There is no set social group on FB and Instagram  trying to find as many friends as possible.
  - He cannot interact with people in the same way.
  - If it is too many people, it becomes a mob mentality.
- Negative experience with mass social media:
  - He has seen it negatively affect people.
- He got rid of social media very quickly!! Why? There were not tools to build that depth.
- Coffee Meets Bagel --> Less impulse control. There is a lot more information.

- People don’t know what they want. People who say that they don’t want impulse under control.
- Social media advertisements have an unknown effect. He is being socially/cognitively conditioned on something.
- Do not assume that people have the self-awareness to stop themselves from being taken advantage of.

- Problem: the baseline has been set, and it has gotten worse. Hopefully, we rebound.
